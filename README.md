# Employee-Analytics-Dashboard-in-Tableau
## Overview
HR management wants to identify and understand trends and issues related to employee retention, satisfaction, and demographic distribution to enable more informed decision-making regarding recruitment, training, and retention strategies. 
The project created a dashboard to answer the following business questions so as to achieve the objectives above.
- What is the total number of employees, and how many are currently active within the company?
- What is the current attrition rate of the company?
- Which departments are experiencing the highest attrition?
- Does the field of education correlate with attrition rates among employees?
- Are certain age groups more likely to leave the company?
- What is the average age of the workforce?
- How satisfied are employees with their job roles across the company?

## Data Source
The raw data was obtained from Kaggle. See [HR Analytics Dataset (kaggle.com) ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshika2301/hr-analytics-dataset)https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshika2301/hr-analytics-dataset

## Insights and Findings
Based on the dashboard, here are some observations and insights:
- The dashboard shows a total employee count of 1,470, out of which 1,233 are active. This might indicate that a significant portion of employees are either on leave or no longer with the company.
- The attrition rate is 16.12%, which could be compared with industry benchmarks to determine if it's within acceptable limits.
- The majority of attrition seems to be in the R&D and Sales departments. This could be an indicator of stress or dissatisfaction within these departments or possibly a reflection of industry-specific turnover rates.
- Most of the attrition is amongst employees from Life Sciences and Medical educational backgrounds. This may warrant a closer look into the career progression and job satisfaction within this group.
- Attrition Rate by Age Category: The highest attrition rate is within the 25-34 age group. This age group often represents employees who are in the growth phase of their career and might be looking for better opportunities outside if they are not satisfied with the current growth or development programs.
- The average age of employees is 37, which indicates a fairly mature workforce. Strategies to attract younger talent might be required to ensure generational diversity.
- The satisfaction ratings are distributed across the scale. It may be useful to investigate the causes behind lower satisfaction levels in specific job roles, as this could be a contributing factor to the attrition rate.
